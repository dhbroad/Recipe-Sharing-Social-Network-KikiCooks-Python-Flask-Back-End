If Cloning from an existing project:
step 1. Clone from GitHub repository
    git clone and-then-insert-the-url-in-place-of-this-text
step 2. Create venv
    python -m venv my_venv
    (click yes when asked if you would like to make it your workspace folder)
step 3. Activate venv
    my_venv\Scripts\Activate
step 4. Install the requirements file in your venv AFTER activating 
    pip install -r requirements.txt
step 5. If you would like to change the GitHub repository, delete the .git file by going to your Windows File Explorer, navigating to this directory, showing hidden files, and deleting .git
step 6. If you deleted the existing .git repository, you must create a new .git if you would like to upload your work to GitHub
    git init
step 7. Create new environmental variables file called .env on the same folder level as this Notes file
Your .env should look like this:
FLASK_APP=run.py
FLASK_ENV=development
SECRET_KEY=shohaisthegoat
DATABASE_URL=postgresql:// <-- ADD YOUR DATABASE HOST URL AFTER THE "//"


Changing the environment to development gives you back helpful errors. Otherwise, you won't be able to tell what went wrong, but when you officially release your application, you change the environment back to "production"

Blueprints are all the routes that you want to split up because they serve different purposes on your website and have multiple sub-routes associated with them.
You create the instance of each route in their respective routes.py file with:
from flask import Blueprint
blue-print-name = Blueprint('blue-print-name', __name__, template_folder='whatever-you-call-your-templates-folder')
Templates folders, for blueprints you create, can be called whatever-the-blueprint-name-is_templates because you're assigning the name of the template_folder above in Blueprint()
HOWEVER, The templates folder in the root level of our app HAS to be named templates because of how the built-in render_templates() module in our app's routes.py looks for template folders
Any time you are using built-in methods/functions/modules, you can hover over them to see what they take in and get a brief description of what they do

pip list (shows everything you've pip installed)
pip freeze (adds everything you've pip installed to requirements.txt)

create a .gitignore and list all of the files you would not like to send when pushing to GitHub 

Whenever someone types anything into the browser, they are doing a GET request

Anytime you make changes to your database, you have to Migrate the changes
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade

Linking to Heroku:
Create Procfile and put in web: gunicorn app:app
Create project on heroku.com
On heroku, set Config Vars to:
SECRET_KEY and whatever-your-secret-key-is
DATABASE_URL and whatever-your-elephantSQL-url-is

Creating Flask App From the Ground Up - Shorthand Steps
0. python -m venv my_venv
1. Initialize (config.py, __init__.py)
2. Create .env file
3. pip install python-dotenv
4. Routes 
5. Blueprints 
6. pip install Flask-WTF Flask-Migrate Flask-SQLAlchemy
7. Models 
8. Link database to app
9. Forms
10. pip install email-validator

12. {{ form.hidden_tag() }} needs to be added to the html signup page
11. Create Static folder for files that don't changed like CSS, Images, JS, etc...
12. Add secret key to config.py and .env
13. Host your database on ElephantSQL and add DATABASE_URL to .env (Make sure to change postgres to postgresql)
14. pip install psycopg2
15. 
16. pip install flask-login
17. Tie in LoginManager to app
18. link web app to heroku
20. pip install gunicorn
21. Connect to any APIs
